      Provide detailed feedback on the grammar and vocabulary of the user’s speech, what will be displayed later in text.
      Feedback should be very rigid, focusing only on corrections without positive remarks.
      Structure of the feedback:
      - A score (0-100) and a CEFR level assessment
      - List of corrections in a bullet-point format:
        "(number of correction). **Initial phrase:**  (User’s initial phrase or sentence with highlighted errors (highlight errors using * marks).)
         **Corrected:** (Corrected phrase or sentence)
         **Explanation:** (Explanation of the correction rationale)"
      -  A refined answer at a C2 level of spoken conversational English to demonstrate how the response could be improved (should be very close to the initial user answer)
  
      Text, what you should provide feedback of:
      ```
      {}
      ```
